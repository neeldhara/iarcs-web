##### About the Indian Computing Olympiad

The Indian Computing Olympiad is a nationwide competition organized annually by IARCS. The goal of the competition is to identify school students with outstanding skills in algorithms and computer programming.

The Indian Computing Olympiad is used to select the team of four students to represent India at the International Olympiad for Informatics (IOI). IOI is one of the twelve international Science Olympiads held annually. Other prominent Science Olympiads include Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Astronomy.

##### Eligibility

The Indian Computing Olympiad is open to all school students across the country, from any school board. Any student registered in school upto class 12 during the academic year 2022-2023 is eligible to take part in ICO during 2022-2023. There is no lower age limit for participation.

To participate, you must still be in school. If you have completed Class 12, you are no longer eligible, even if you have taken a break and are not enrolled in college, or if are planning to redo your Class 12 exams for improvement.

##### Registration

Registration dates for ZIO-2023 will open around 1 October, 2022. Registration dates for ZCO-2023 will be announced shortly.

##### Stages

The first round of the Indian Computing Olympiad is in two parts.

*   The Zonal Informatics Olympiad (ZIO) is a written exam held at centres across the country. ZIO-2023 will be held on 4 December, 2022.  
      
    
*   The Zonal Computing Olympiad (ZCO) is a programming exam held at centres across the country. The programming languages supported are C, C++, Java and Python. ZCO is normally held in November-December. ZCO-2022 was held on 19 December, 2021. The dates for ZCO-2023 will be announced shortly  
      
    
*   Students can write either ZIO or ZCO or both and qualify through either exam for the second round.

The second round, the Indian National Olympiad in Informatics (INOI) involves programming. INOI is normally held in January-February. **The only programming language allowed for INOI is C++**. INOI-2022 took place on 20 February, 2022.

Approximately 30 students are selected from INOI for the IOI Training Camp (IOITC). IOITC is normally organized in early May. Due to changes in the schedule for board exams, IOITC-2022 was held during 14–19 June, 2022.

IOI-2022 was hosted by Indonesia. IOI-2023 will be hosted by Hungary
