Since 2003-2004, IARCS has made available grants for partial support to travel to conferences and other academic meetings in all areas of Computing Science, both in India and abroad.

*   _From 2014, these grants are jointly sponsored by [ACM India](http://india.acm.org). With this additional funding, the quantum of support available for individual grants has been enhanced. The application procedure remains the same and the grants will continue to be administered through IARCS._  
      
    
*   From 2008-2010, these grants were sponsored by a generous contribution from [Geodesic Information Systems Ltd](http://www.geodesic.com).

#### Eligibility

To apply for a grant, you have to be affiliated as a student or a faculty member to an academic institution based in India.

Grants are available to support travel to an academic conference outside the country. The support can be used to cover travel costs and conference registration fees.

**_Note:_**

*   ACM India-IARCS travel grants are intended for work directly related to computing science. We are not in a position to support applications in other subjects, even if it involves computational or numerical work.  
      
    
*   ACM India-IARCS grants are normally restricted to **Rs 60,000 (max Rs 1,00,000)**.  
      
    
*   ACM India-IARCS funding can be used as partial support to cover items such as travel expenses, registration fees and accommodation that are not already covered by other sources of funding. Per diem expenses and other expenditure without bills and/or receipts cannot be claimed.  
      
    
*   ACM India and IARCS do not provide direct grants to individuals for events held within India. For events in India, the organizers should contact ACM India or IARCS directly for institutional support.  
      
    
*   ACM India-IARCS travel grants are intended for presenting original research work at international conferences. IARCS does not provide support for travel or local expenses for instructional schools or for internships and other long-term visits.  
      
    
*   ACM India and IARCS will give preference to students who are enrolled in a graduate programme (Integrated Masters, Integrated PhD, Masters, or PhD). ACM India and IARCS will not normally provide support to faculty members from well-funded institutions such as IITs, IISc, IIITs, TIFR, IMSc, CMI, IISERs etc.  
      
    
*   To ensure a more equitable utilization of the limited travel grant budget, ACM India and IARCS will not fund the same individual twice in any 12 month period.
